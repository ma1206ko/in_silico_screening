Novel in silico screening system for plant defense activators using deep learning-based prediction of reactive oxygen species accumulation.  

### research summary
Plant defense activators offer advantages over pesticides by avoiding the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. However, only a limited number of compounds have been reported. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as not only antimicrobial agents but also signaling molecules that trigger immune responses. They also affect various cellular processes, highlighting the potential ROS modulators as plant defense activators. Establishing a high-throughput screening system for ROS modulators holds great promise for identifying lead chemical compounds with novel modes of action (MoAs).
Results: We established a novel in silico screening system for plant defense activators using deep learning-based predictions of ROS accumulation combined with the chemical properties of the compounds as explanatory variables. Our screening strategy comprised four phases: (1) development of a ROS inference system based on a deep neural network that combines ROS production data in plant cells and multidimensional chemical features of chemical compounds(using "drug_ros_smote"); (2) in silico extensive-scale screening of seven million commercially available compounds using the ROS inference model; (3) secondary screening by visualization of the chemical space of compounds using the generative topographic mapping(using "GTM_drug_chemical_space"); and (4) confirmation and validation of the identified compounds as potential ROS modulators within plant cells. We further characterized the effects of selected chemical compounds on plant cells using molecular biology methods, including pathogenic signal-triggered enzymatic ROS induction and programmed cell death as immune responses. Our results indicate that deep learning-based screening systems can rapidly and effectively identify potential immune signal-inducible ROS modulators with distinct chemical characteristics compared with the actual ROS measurement system in plant cells.
Conclusions: We developed a model system capable of inferring a diverse range of ROS activity control agents that activate immune responses through the assimilation of chemical features of candidate pesticide compounds. By employing this system in the prescreening phase of actual ROS measurement in plant cells, we anticipate enhanced efficiency and reduced pesticide discovery costs. The in-silico screening methods for identifying plant ROS modulators hold the potential to facilitate the development of diverse plant defense activators with novel MoAs.
